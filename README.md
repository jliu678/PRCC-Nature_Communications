# Project Abstract
The role of the Hippo signaling pathway in renal cell carcinoma remains unclear. Large-scale
cancer genetic/genomic studies demonstrated that papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is
featured with a frequent shallow deletion of the upstream tumor suppressors of the Hippo/YAP
signaling pathway, suggesting that this signaling pathway may play a role in pRCC development.
We developed a transgenic mouse model with a renal epithelial cell-specific hyperactivation of
YAP1 and found that hyperactivation of YAP1 could induce dedifferentiation and transformation
of renal tubular epithelial cells leading to the development of pRCC. We analyzed at the single53
cell resolution the cellular landscape alterations during cancer initiation and progression. Our data
indicated that the hyperactivated YAP1, via manipulating multiple signaling pathways, induced
epithelial cell transformation, MDSC (Myeloid-derived suppressor cells) accumulation, and pRCC
development. Interestingly, we found that depletion of MDSC blocked YAP1-induced kidney
overgrowth and tumorigenesis. Inhibiting YAP1 activity with MGH-CP1, a newly developed TEAD
inhibitor, blocked MDSC accumulation and suppressed tumor development. Our results identify
the disrupted Hippo/YAP signaling as a major contributor to pRCC and suggest that targeting the
disrupted Hippo pathway represents a novel strategy to prevent and treat pRCC.
